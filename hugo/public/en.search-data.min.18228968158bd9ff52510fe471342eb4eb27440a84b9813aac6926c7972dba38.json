They are recipes, usually implemented on a computer following a Turing machine (or a Von Neumann architectured machine), but can also refer to those that are done on an abstract lambda calculus.\nIn particular, algorithms are usually clever recipes implemented to solve a particular problem. This can involve things like: how to count the number of ways to make change for a certain number of dollars; how to find the fastest route from start to finish in a given topology; or how to arrange a set of jumbled numbers into an orderly sequence.\ndata structures # Data structures, on the other hand, are abstract structures that allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in convenient ways.\nWhat we mean by \u0026ldquo;convenient\u0026rdquo; can vary \u0026mdash; maybe it means we can do something quickly. Maybe it means we can yank out a certain element of the dataset quickly. Or maybe it means we can add something to a collection quickly.\nData structures are closely related to algorithms. For instance, we might need a clever algorithm to set up a data structure in a meaningfully quick way. Or maybe a data structure relies on a clever algorithm to retrieve or modify an existing data element.\nData structures come in many many flavors:\nmaybe we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a tree, which is a data structure that has a hierarchical quality to it; this can enable, for instance, fast lookups if we have a balanced binary tree. graphs are data structures and can be represented on a computer in many ways; they represent datasets where the individual elements have some sort of connection with other elements. We have randomized, or _probabilistic data structures: structures that don\u0026rsquo;t offer a hard-and-fast guarantee of good performance, but guarantee good performance \u0026ldquo;almost all the time\u0026rdquo;, by using randomness in the underlying methods. Another popular structure is the hash table, or just table. These rely on the properties of certain mathematical functions, called hash functions, to provide fast lookups.

(Yes, I stole that from wikipedia.)\nToday, the collective attention1 of the field is focused on deep learning \u0026mdash; the technique that\u0026rsquo;s taken the subject by storm ever since results showed that they could be highly-scalable with respect to data and compute. But ML spans far beyond that, and includes classical methods like clustering, tree-based models, and mathematical techniques like integer programming and planning methods (e.g., computational methods based on Bellman\u0026rsquo;s equation).\nThis overview introduces a few of the major components underpinning modern ML: linear algebra and probability theory. In the sub-entries, we\u0026rsquo;ll dig a bit deeper.\nlinear algebra # Linear algebra is one of those rare fields of mathematics where (almost) everything is fully understood. It is the theory behind vectors, matrices, and multidmensional (rigid) geometry.\nprobability theory # Probability theory and statistics is just as fundamental. It is the mathematical description of randomness, of different \u0026ldquo;versions\u0026rdquo; of randomness (i.e. different probability distributions) arising from different random processes, and the study of how these differences lead to differing sampled outcomes. Inferential statistics discusses how to recover probability distributions, or certain aspects of probability distributions, from a finite number of samples.\nBa dum tishhhhh.
