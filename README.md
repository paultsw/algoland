#  algorithm land
=================

`algorithm.land` is a directory of algorithms, data structures, and machine learning models implemented in python for autodidactic purposes.

Currently, we have the following sections and subcategories listed below.


Core Algorithms and Data Structures
---------------
These are algorithms and data structures that every person working in tech should optimally know and be able to conjure up from scratch.

Advanced Algorithms
-------------------
Things you don't see so often, such as the Boyer-Moore voting algorithm, how to write a Fast Fourier Transform, and so on.

Machine Learning Models
-----------------------
Common machine learning models --- from "classical" machine learning. This can also include content like broader examples of expectation-maximization, variational Bayes, etc --- even though these are more "meta-"algorithms rather than specific algorithms or models _per se_.

About
-----
By `@paultsw`.

The genesis of this project was that:
1) I'm somewhat obsessive-compulsive about collecting and cataloguing knowledge; and
2) I had to prepare for technical interviews.
