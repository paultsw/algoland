    Implement Merge Sort, a common divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
    supposedly invented by John von Neumann in the 1960s.

    The way that Merge Sort works is that it involves two components:
    1) a division step where at each stage, each (sub-)array gets cut in
       half and each half gets recursively sorted; and
    2) a merge operation in which two sorted arrays get merged together.
